h1. ConfigSmart

This app was created as part of the 2014 Equifax Hackathon.

The problem statement was to create a configuration management solution that 
could support developers and system level configurations, as well as Client Services users 
that often add new customers and need to set preferences and configurations for them.

h2. Play around

The demo app is running live at "config-smart.herokuapp.com":http://config-smart.herokuapp.com
Feel free to check it out, clone the repo and play around. (we will reset it back to the default every day)

WE would love some feedback!
You can join us in our public team chat (you'll see it at the bottom of the app)

h2. Clone and Run the Application

It'll help if you have ruby/rails/git already set up!

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/dacat/configurator.git
$ cd configurator
</pre>

Now we need to install the dependencies (keep an eye on it, you might get an error at the top and not see it fly by)
<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

Let's get the db set up
<pre>
$ rake db:setup
</pre>

(well that was easy)

Now let's fire up the server and kick the tires.
<pre>
$ rails server
</pre>

Check out the app at "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

You don't have to create a user to test it out, just pick one from the drop down.
(I don't want you to waste time typing in fake user info. Just get in there and break some stuff!!)


...What?  the setup didn't go so well for you?

h2. What if that didn't work?

Try Nitrous.io, everything works great on nitrous!
